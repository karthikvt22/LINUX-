Do you really know the structure of your OS?



Imagine, you have your house (the OS), and it’s understood that you know all the parts of your house. Why? So that if a thief enters, you can escape! even if the lights are off.

No no, this isn’t about knowing your house, it’s about understanding your Linux, specifically how the Linux filesystem is structured.

But before we even get into that... How does the terminal even understand a command?
-> Whenever you enter a command in the terminal, it scans the system's PATH to look for related executables. If it finds something related (like a binary), it executes it.
--For example, when you type ls, its binary is already installed in a directory like /bin, so it runs instantly. Cool, right?

SOO COMING TO THE MAIN PART
A). root@ubuntu-dev:/# → This is the Linux shell prompt, and it shows who you are, which computer you're on, and where you are in the system.
B). /home → Default location for user home directories.
C). /sbin → System binaries, all the administrative commands are present here, like useradd.
D). /lib → Libraries, used by the Linux kernel to execute system calls or actions.
E). /boot → Contains binaries which help the system load whenever the system is booted again.
