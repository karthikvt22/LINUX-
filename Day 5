Part 1->Process Management in Linux 🤷‍♂️ 


A process is a running program, like an app or a script. When multiple processes are running, Linux assumes the ones using the most CPU or memory are the most important, but that’s not always the case. To manage this, Linux provides several commands for viewing, controlling, and prioritizing processes.

->>Viewing Processes
ps aux –> View all running processes
ps -u username –> View processes for a specific user
ps -C processname –> Show a process by name
pgrep processname –> Find a process by name and get its PID
pidof processname –> Find the PID of a running program
