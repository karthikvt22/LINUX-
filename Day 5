Part 1->Process Management in Linux 🤷‍♂️ 

A process is a running program, like an app or a script. When multiple processes are running, Linux assumes the ones using the most CPU or memory are the most important, but that’s not always the case. To manage this, Linux provides several commands for viewing, controlling, and prioritizing processes.

->>Viewing Processes
ps aux –> View all running processes
ps -u username –> View processes for a specific user
ps -C processname –> Show a process by name
pgrep processname –> Find a process by name and get its PID
pidof processname –> Find the PID of a running program

->>Managing Processes
kill PID –> Terminate a process by its PID
pkill processname –> Terminate a process by name
kill -9 PID –> Force kill a process
pkill -9 processname –> Kill all instances of a process
kill -STOP PID –> Stop a running process
kill -CONT PID –> Resume a stopped process
renice -n 10 -p PID –> Lower priority of a process
renice -n -5 -p PID –> Increase priority (requires root access)

->>Background & Foreground Processes
command & –> Run a command in the background
jobs –> List background jobs
fg %jobnumber –> Bring a job to the foreground
Ctrl + Z –> Suspend a running process
bg %jobnumber –> Resume a suspended process in the background

->>Daemon Process Management
systemctl list-units --type=service –> List system services (daemons)
systemctl start service-name –> Start a service
systemctl stop service-name –> Stop a service
systemctl enable service-name –> Enable a service at startup

The important takeaway is how nice and renice commands help me control the priority of processes. A lower nice value means a higher priority, and a higher nice value means a lower priority.
