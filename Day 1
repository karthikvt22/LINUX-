Imagine this…

All your apps your browser, your code editor, your music player are fighting over your CPU, memory, and disk at the same time, no rules, no separation, just pure chaos !😵‍💫

->Linux is an open-source operating system, basically the layer that sits between you (the user) and your hardware (like CPU, RAM, disk, etc.).

->It makes sure apps don’t fight for resources, keeps everything organized, and protects your system from crashing or leaking data. 

Why Linux though?
