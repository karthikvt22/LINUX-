Do you love ice cream?


I sure do! But my mom used to restrict me from having it. Even though it was right there, I had to ask for permission to enjoy it ,whether it was meant for me (user), my family (group), or guests (others).

Sounds familiar? Well, Linux does the same thing with file permissions! (Okay, maybe not with ice cream, but you get the idea ðŸ˜…)

Okay, back to the topic ,now, when you want to check what permissions a file or directory has, you can use the ls -ltr command. 

->One of the first things you'll notice is something like this: -|rw-|rwx-|r--|. 
This string of characters shows file permissions for three types of users: the user (owner), the group, and others. They always follow that order.
To modify these permissions, Linux provides the chmod command (short for change mode).
