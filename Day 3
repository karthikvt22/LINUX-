USER MANAGEMENT –> In an organization where their applications run on Linux servers and employees(users) are handling it, user management is crucial and plays a vital role.

-> Like, just imagine, what if a junior developer accidentally deletes some important files? Or maybe someone’s cooking something fishy on the servers?
Your servers might be on the edge of getting corrupted. That’s why user management is super important for proper authentication, authorization, and other key steps.

So on my 3rd day of Linux, I learnt about user management like adding, deleting users, groups, and setting passwords!

->USER-- A user is basically anyone who logs into the Linux system.
->GROUP-- A group is a collection of users. Instead of giving permissions one by one, you can assign them to the whole group.

Now coming to the commands:
1. How to add a user?
 There are two ways:
 a) useradd username
 b) adduser username –> this also attaches a home directory to the user.
2. How to check if it’s added or not?
 -> cat /etc/passwd
3. How to delete a user?
 -> userdel username
4. How to set a password for the user?
-> passwd username
5. How to check if the password is added?
 -> cat /etc/shadow
6. How to create groups?
 -> groupadd name_of_group
7. How to check if the group is created?
 -> cat /etc/group
8. How to add users to a group?
 -> usermod -aG groupname username
--->> Now after creating a new user and credentials for an employee, how will they connect to the server?
-> By default, the server runs sshd, and the user should install something like an SSH client which will help them connect using the credentials shared by the admin or root. Simple, right?
